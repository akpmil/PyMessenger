# PyMessenger
A simple network message application using Python 3.

## Project features

### Requirements

* TCP sockets will be used to ensure that all messages are sent and received.
* Each client must update their display automatically upon receiving a message.

### Additional features 
* Clients should be allowed to send other media types such as images, video, and other supported file formats.
* Messages between clients should automatically be encrypted.
* A client/server model can be introduced to allow messages to be stored whilst the receiving client is offline. Notifications that when the client is back online or message has been delivered can also be relayed back to the sender.
